    <<~EOS
      Relo keeps data in ~/.relo. Stop the daemon before removing Relo so
      the ports it serves are freed:
        relo daemon stop --force
      `brew uninstall relo` keeps your data, like apt and npm do. To remove
      the program and the data: `relo uninstall --wipe`, then
      `brew uninstall relo`. Do not use `brew services`; autostart is
      `relo autostart enable|disable`.

  # Single-method rule: at most one Relo provides the relo command. A

  # keeps updating through its own method, or is removed completely
  # first. Two installs would fight over the name, the home directory,
  # and the ports. This formula's own link, including the previous keg
  # during an upgrade, is never a conflict.
